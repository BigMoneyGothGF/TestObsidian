When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. <strong>Antimagic field</strong> has no effect on the wall, and <strong>dispel magic</strong> can affect only the violet layer.</p><p><strong>1. Red.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</p><p><strong>2. Orange.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</p><p><strong>3. Yellow.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</p><p><strong>4. Green.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</p><p><strong>5. Blue.</strong> The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</p><p><strong>6. Indigo.</strong> On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a <strong>daylight</strong> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</p><p><strong>7. Violet.</strong> On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a <strong>dispel magic</strong> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.</p>"}},"flags":{"obsidian":{"source":{},"time":{"n":1,"type":"action"},"duration":{"n":10,"type":"min"},"range":{"n":60,"type":"short"},"components":{"r":false,"s":true,"v":true,"m":false},"effects":[{"name":"Spell","uuid":"553ee1d8-fe2e-41d2-a850-d87f04a73547","components":[{"type":"damage","uuid":"ed0770e3-201e-4201-880c-61ba9f495f2c","versatile":false,"damage":"fir","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6},{"type":"damage","uuid":"d2f89eeb-ed76-485f-ab28-3a8cb8d7eb5b","versatile":false,"damage":"acd","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6},{"type":"damage","uuid":"383931a9-29d6-460b-bbb7-a0f583e791e0","versatile":false,"damage":"lig","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6},{"type":"damage","uuid":"64d467a8-ad9c-4576-b1eb-f53c07fce3d6","versatile":false,"damage":"psn","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6},{"type":"damage","uuid":"c1d7b8e5-76ae-4f43-ae37-2a0764b550f9","versatile":false,"damage":"cld","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":10,"die":6}]}]}}}

Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p><p>This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.</p><p><strong>Fissures.</strong> Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 &times; 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.</p><p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p><p><strong>Structures.</strong> The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.</p>"}},"flags":{"obsidian":{"source":{},"time":{"n":1,"type":"action"},"duration":{"n":1,"type":"min"},"range":{"n":500,"type":"short"},"components":{"r":false,"s":true,"v":true,"m":true},"effects":[{"name":"Spell","uuid":"a8f3752f-b830-4643-bc3b-a7b07825de15","components":[{"type":"damage","uuid":"64d0902c-b894-442c-ab22-be7ca9dad621","versatile":false,"damage":"blg","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":5,"die":6}]}]}}}

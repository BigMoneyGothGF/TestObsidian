State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p><p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <strong>wish</strong> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>"}},"flags":{"obsidian":{"version":2,"source":{"type":"custom","custom":"Custom"},"time":{"n":1,"type":"action"},"duration":{"n":0,"type":"instant"},"range":{"n":0,"type":"self"},"components":{"r":false,"s":true,"v":false,"m":false},"effects":[]}}}

If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

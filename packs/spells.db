If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p><p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench.

Distance off target is 1d10 Ã— 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.

You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><ul><li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li><li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li><li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <strong>wish</strong> spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li></ul><p> <br>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples.

This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p><p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment.

The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.</p><p>The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space. <br>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.</p><p><strong>Clenched Fist.</strong> The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p><p><strong>Forceful Hand.</strong> The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p><p><strong>Grasping Hand.</strong> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><strong>Interposing Hand.</strong> The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>"},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":1,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":120,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["4d8","force"]],"versatile":"2d6","value":""},"formula":"1d20+8","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"value":""},"level":5,"school":"evo","components":{"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"an eggshell and a snakeskin glove"},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"level","formula":"2d8"}},"flags":{"obsidian":{"version":2,"source":{"type":"custom","custom":"Custom"},"time":{"n":1,"type":"action"},"duration":{"n":1,"type":"min"},"range":{"n":120,"type":"short"},"components":{"r":false,"s":true,"v":true,"m":true},"effects":[{"name":"","uuid":"f35258a1-57e6-4b53-ba92-df98515c7748","components":[{"type":"damage","uuid":"cc36ac6a-b662-45ea-8c36-6cc1e9812538","versatile":false,"damage":"frc","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":4,"die":8},{"type":"damage","uuid":"fc816c72-e7c7-4e79-aa88-aa5833061d2d","versatile":false,"damage":"blg","ability":"spell","calc":"formula","ndice":2,"die":6}]},{"name":"Scaling","uuid":"553d07d4-4dfd-4f74-a67f-b20e8e58c7fe","components":[{"type":"scaling","uuid":"0084a1d3-43c7-4656-a502-9031e57d61a1","method":"spell","ref":"f35258a1-57e6-4b53-ba92-df98515c7748"},{"type":"damage","uuid":"d643a860-0489-4679-94ae-c5291746a0f3","versatile":false,"damage":"frc","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":2,"die":8},{"type":"damage","uuid":"9c083571-9248-4978-b164-b29a8e5de860","versatile":false,"damage":"blg","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":2,"die":6}]}]}}}

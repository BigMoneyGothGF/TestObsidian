The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><ul><li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li><li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li><li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <strong>wish</strong> spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<br>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p><p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p><p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p><p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as <strong>magic missile</strong> and <strong>charm person</strong>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p><p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <strong>fireball</strong>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <strong>wall of fire</strong> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a <strong>longsword, +1</strong>&nbsp;in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p><p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p><p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the <strong>rope trick</strong> spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p><p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p><p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells and magical effects such as <strong>dispel magic</strong> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different <strong>antimagic field</strong> spells don't nullify each other.</p>"},"source":"PHB pg. 213","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"hour"},"target":{"value":10,"units":"","type":"sphere"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"value":""},"level":8,"school":"abj","components":{"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings"},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"flags":{"obsidian":{"version":2,"source":{"type":"custom","custom":"Custom"},"time":{"n":1,"type":"action"},"duration":{"n":1,"type":"hour"},"range":{"n":0,"type":"self"},"components":{"r":false,"s":true,"v":true,"m":true},"effects":[{"name":"Spell","uuid":"21cc291d-3838-453b-a183-9e8508092b91","components":[{"type":"target","uuid":"8765d53e-b009-4440-a8fa-dce8f9f62747","target":"area","count":1,"area":"sphere","distance":10}]}]}}}

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

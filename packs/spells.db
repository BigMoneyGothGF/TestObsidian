Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><h3>Animated Object Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>HP</th><th>AC</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th><th>Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>20</td><td>18</td><td>4</td><td>18</td><td>+8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>25</td><td>16</td><td>6</td><td>14</td><td>+6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>40</td><td>13</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>+5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>50</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>10</td><td>+6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>80</td><td>10</td><td>18</td><td>6</td><td>+8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage</td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size.

Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p><p><strong>Forceful Hand.</strong> The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p><p><strong>Grasping Hand.</strong> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><strong>Interposing Hand.</strong> The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>"},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":1,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":120,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["4d8","force"]],"versatile":"2d6","value":""},"formula":"1d20+8","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"value":""},"level":5,"school":"evo","components":{"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"an eggshell and a snakeskin glove"},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"level","formula":"2d8"}},"flags":{"obsidian":{"version":2,"source":{"type":"custom","custom":"Custom"},"time":{"n":1,"type":"action"},"duration":{"n":1,"type":"min"},"range":{"n":120,"type":"short"},"components":{"r":false,"s":true,"v":true,"m":true},"effects":[{"name":"Spell","uuid":"2ecd3caf-ea6f-4133-9234-a14aba79fb92","components":[{"type":"damage","uuid":"21e31c76-27c5-4e18-bb7e-f46ab7ea2616","versatile":false,"damage":"frc","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":4,"die":8},{"type":"damage","uuid":"67a5e0d9-cd10-4865-b876-2a5290e0bc87","versatile":false,"damage":"blg","ability":"spell","calc":"formula","ndice":2,"die":6}]},{"name":"Scaling","uuid":"9233132b-b37e-455b-a17f-5c3b883614fc","components":[{"type":"scaling","uuid":"059a23c8-3f71-41ac-8486-8af649edffcd","method":"spell","ref":"2ecd3caf-ea6f-4133-9234-a14aba79fb92"},{"type":"damage","uuid":"06f981df-79c1-49ea-9bbd-6005165bb491","versatile":false,"damage":"frc","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":2,"die":8},{"type":"damage","uuid":"eaa9f3fb-5e8b-43a4-85c2-a41f16690dcc","versatile":false,"damage":"blg","ability":"","calc":"formula","ndice":2,"die":6}]}]}}}
